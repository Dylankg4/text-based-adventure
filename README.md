# text-based-adventure
Coded with a friend around a year ago.
Has some bugs like the fle function not working anymore. Has an interesting sense of humor. Designed to be endless though not much variety.
Dungeon will get longer and have different enemies appear as you level up. Two cheat code can be found in the code to get more money and magic rocks to unclock -
spells or other things based on class.
